## 🔹 Key Features  
- Cleaned and preprocessed COVID-19 datasets (confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths).  
- Analyzed **daily, weekly, and monthly trends** of COVID-19 cases.  
- Compared **country-wise statistics** (top affected countries, recovery rates, death rates).  
- Visualized data with:  
  - Line plots for trends over time  
  - Bar charts for country comparisons  
  - Heatmaps for correlations  
- Generated actionable insights from raw datasets.
